# TFAA

Texas Fine Arts Administrators (TFAA) ([link](https://www.texasfineartsadmin.org/))

(Formerly the Texas Music Administrators Conference (TMAC) ([link](https://www.texasmusicadmin.com/)))

This website was constructed for Jeff Turner, Mario Luna, and the Texas Music Administrators Conference. Planning began in January 2018 with building starting in mid-February 2018.

Starting in November 2022, a new design was built by Luis Velasquez at [LV Branding](https://www.lvbranding.com/). The new design launched in early February 2023.

## Tools

- GatsbyJS
- React
- Contentful (as CMS)
- Cloudinary (as CDN)
- Firebase for authentication
- Firestore for data storage
- Google Scripts to sync with Firebase data
- MUI
- TypeScript (partially implemented)

### Gatsby Plugins

- `gatsby-theme-material-ui`
  - This provides up-to-date MUI components and theming. Some components like `Link` have been updated to work with Gatsby.
- `@sentry/gatsby`
  - Adds ability for Sentry to catch exceptions that users encounter on the site. Check the attached Sentry account for info on specific errors.
  - All Sentry packages need to be on the same version.
- `gatsby-source-contentful`
  - These parts of the site fetch data from Contentful at build time:
    - Officers
    - Area Representatives
    - Some Events
  - If the Contentful data is updated, a TFAA dev needs to re-deploy the site on Netliy for the changes to go live.
- `gatsby-plugin-typography`
  - Allows adding custom fonts
- `gatsby-plugin-canonical-urls`
  - Inserts a `link` tag in the head of each page with `rel="canonical"` added. This helps ensure that all saved pages everywhere will point to the `https` address for this site.

## Inspiration

Heavily inspired by the Gatsby v1 documentation website.

## Running in development

1. Clone this repo
1. Add `.env` file based on `example.env`. Get secret values from another TFAA dev.
2. Install dependencies → `yarn`
3. Start the development server → `yarn dev`
